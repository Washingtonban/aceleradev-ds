## WHAT IS ACELERADEV?
It is a free training program for technology professionals. For 10 weeks, devs and data scientists have access to challenges, content and the Codenation Community to acquire and practice the technical skills most used by technology companies around the world.

## SUPPORTING COMPANIES
Large technology companies from Brazil and abroad, looking to find talent to integrate their technology teams. Codenation's partner companies monitor the evolution of participants during the program and can make job offers to those with the desired profile.

## HOW IT WORKS

### 1-CHALLENGE [16.03 to 05.04]
Sign up and submit the selection challenge. To get one of the vacancies, you need to reach 90% in Data Science or 100% in other technologies. If you are having difficulties, use the challenge channel in the Codenation Community. Note: if you have reached the minimum score in previous selection processes, you will automatically enter this acceleration when you register.

### 2-ACCELERATION [06.04 to 15.06]
Each week, a new module is released. These modules are composed of challenges, videos and content aligned with the market reality so that you learn through practice.

### 3-PROJECT [Submission until 15.06]
The acceleration has a practical design module, which must be developed individually. Although optional, this is the best way for you to show your code (and potential) to companies that are keeping an eye on your class.

### COMMUNITY
By participating in an AceleraDev, you gain access to your class's private channel in the Community. There, you can (and should) interact with others, asking for and offering help with the challenges of each week.

### HIRING
During and after the program, the supporting companies will keep an eye on the engagement of those who participate in AceleraDev and will be able to contact those who demonstrate the potential sought
